About MaceHammer Fitness
---------------------------------
MaceHammer Fitness is an innovative exercise equipment manufacturing company focused on asking the question: "What can we do to create a better exercise experience?  As a small company we are guided by the principle, "if we don't personally use it, we don't sell it."


Located in Columbus, Ohio we believe in old-school values and treat our customers as if they were our training partners. Our success is not based on the number of products we sell but on providing a unique and satisfying experience to those who do buy our products.


Committed to "*Made in the USA*," our materials are purchased regionally, and our products manufactured locally. Our products have a limited life time warranty.


We understand e-commerce and e-mail, but what we really value is talking to our customers. Our phone number is 614-204-7360 and we answer the phone so we can answer your questions. If you prefer our e-mail address is, macehammerfitness@gmail.com.


Please revisit us as we continue to bring new and innovative products to our site.
