The Core
========
The core is the body's center of power. It essentially consists of the torso minus the arms and legs. The major muscles of the core reside in the pelvic floor, hips, abdomen and the mid and lower back. The major muscles groups are as follows: pelvic floor (psoas, iliacus), hips (gluteus maximus), abdomen (transverus abdominus, internal and external obliques, rectus abdominus) and back (erector spinea, longisimus, Latinisms dorsi, trapezius). All total body movements originate from the core, and it is the source of our strenght, stability and balance.

The core muscles allow for dynamic body movements in three planes of motion or in a combination of planes. The transverse plane (head to toe), the sagittal plane (left to right), and the coronal plane (front to back). These muscle groups are also responsible for our ability to rotate along our long axis.

All of these movements are used on a daily basis to preform basic function (walking, bending, maintaining body posture etc.) and selective skill functions (athletic movements in any sport or activity requiring body movement). It is clear why developing core strength will enhance any and all functional movements. 

MaceHammer training is a total body core exercise with the added benefit of cardio conditioning. It can be preformed as an isolated workout or be incorporated into any training regimen. It's primal nature with the release of adrenaline and production of endorphins provides an outlet for frustration and release of stress.


Use of Tires
============
The MaceHammer is designed and intended for tire impact to achieve maximal workout intensity and minimal injury to joints, tendons, ligaments and soft tissue.

By utilizing the elastic properties of the tire we are able to partially negate Newton's Third Law of motion;  "for every action there is an equal an opposite reaction". By increasing the time duration of applied forces  through tire deformation, energy is transferred to the tire resulting in less energy returned through the hammer and user's body. An example of this is found in a car collision. The front end of the car deforms as it decelerates, absorbing energy in the process with less energy transmitted to the occupant. By using a deformable object (tire) less energy and therefor less stress is placed  on the joints and soft tissue.

Tires are ubiquitous and most tire retail stores are happy to provide them free of charge. They usually pay a fee to dispose of them. Most any tire will suffice however SUV Tires with their wide tract are best. Tractor and farm equipment tires are stiffer than car tires but have the advantage of also being used for "tire flipping" and "tire  tossing".

Tire stations can be creative as shown above or as simple as laying a tire on it's side. Placing tires at different heights and orientations, allows for various swing planes. Any and all types of athletic swings can then be simulated. Tips on stabilizing tires include, weighting them down with bags of sand, anchoring them together with cable wire or bolting together.

Shoulder Preparation
====================
The shoulder is capable of a variety of joint movements:  flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, medial and lateral rotation and circumduction. A total of nine muscles cross the shoulder joint to provide range of motion to the most mobile joint in the body.

Maintaining mobility and flexibility of the muscles, ligaments and tendons is crucial for shoulder health. The MaceHammer Warm Up Clubs allow for a dynamic full range of joint motion with activation of multiple muscle groups. Dynamic stretching and performance of the intended movement to be used in the exercise has proven to be more beneficial vs. static stretching in the prevention of injury. Dynamic stretching increases muscle and body temperature and stimulates joint lubrication through increased blood flow.

Pre and post-exercise warm up and cool down is an individual process often requiring experimentation and drawing on previous experiences. Regardless of the exercise regimen, warming up remains a key element in avoiding potential injury and should be performed prior to any exercise routine.

Our Grip Rope
=============
Increasing your grip strength will improve the functional requirements imposed on your hands and arms during everyday activities, sports (especially when the hands and wrists play a major role) and strength and fitness training. The classic grip exercise routines target the flexor and extensor muscles of the forearm, but often neglect the intrinsic muscles of the hand.

Open Hand Training has gained in popularity consisting of a primary focus on hand specific strengthening movements (crushing, pinching, supporting ).

The Heavy Rope MaceGrip brings open hand training grip training to the core strengthening and conditioning benefits of the heavy rope.

1. Utilize one layer of friction tape with half overlay (baseball bat grip) for rope ends.
2. Rotate the MaceGrip following the directions of the rope braids.
3. If necessary add a second layer of tape or a ring of tape to the end of the rope to secure the MaceGrip  (usually not required).
4. The heavy rope can be utilized with the standard rope grip by grasping the rope just beyond the MaceGrip.
